	  <h1>Audio Compression</h1>
	  <h2>Difference between lossy and lossless audio compression</h2>
	    <p>A definition of lossy compression is a process of shrinking the size of a file while loosing an amount of bits. 
		   On the other hand, lossless compression is the process of shrinking a file while retaining the same amount of bits. 
		   (<em>Bits are single units of information used in files to store binary</em>). 
		   With audio, lossy compression permanently removes parts of the sound human ears cannot easily hear so that the file size is lower to store.
		   Lossless files compress the audio to make the file smaller but does not lose any of the sound quality.</p>
	  <h2>Why use lossy or lossless files</h2>
	    <p>Lossy compression is best used when listening to personal music on devices such as phones.
		   This way more music is stored and it makes no difference to the average listener. 
		   Lossless music is great for people who can hear the difference but still want low compressed files 
		   or people who would like to edit the sound of a song. This way, all the bits are still present resulting in better sounding music.</p>
	  <h2>Types of lossy and lossless audio files</h2>
	    <p>Here are a few different types of popular audio files and the way they compress music:</p>
		  <h4>Lossy files</h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>MP3</li>
			  <li>AAC</li>
			  <li>Ogg Vorbis</li>
			</ul>
		  <h4>Lossless files</h4>
		    <ul>
			  <li>FLAC</li>
			  <li>ALAC</li>
			  <li>WMA</li>
			</ul>
